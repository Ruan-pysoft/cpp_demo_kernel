 - PEDMAS calculator
   - numbers (int only or floats? first int, I think) [ ints done ]
   - ( parentheses ) [ DONE ]
   - power, factorial [ power of done ]
   - multiplication, division, modulo [ ALL DONE ]
   - add, subtract, negate [ ALL DONE ]
   - variable assignment & use
   - true/false + equation checking? (probably for v2)
   - functions: ... something?
   - allow range-based stuff? (sum, product, etc)
 - Minesweeper
   - Do I want to avoid impossible setups?
 - Memory inspector: stats + visual memory overview
   - I think the visual overview should have its own seperate screen;
     if a 64*16 screen area is used, need to represent 256 blocks per screen character
     need possibly sixteen characters + 16 colour combinations to display?
 - Key event viewer (maybe?)
 - Text editor improvements:
   - Navigation inside buffer (+ proper paging)
   - Multiple buffers
   - Open/New/Delete menu
   - Vi mode?
 - Terminal API improvements:
   - Keep track of current cursor config, when enabling cursor auto-restore to previous config
     (start & end scanlines)
   - Auto-disable cursor when aquiring back-buffer? (only re-enable if previously was enabled)
 - Snake improvements:
   - don't move too soon after a user-initiated move (feels janky)
 - Mieliepit improvements (maybe maybe? probably a v2 goal rather...)
   - Remove the single-line constraints (allow longer functions)
 - Migrate to better build system (nob.h probably)
